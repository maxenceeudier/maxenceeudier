### About my studies

If you haven't heard of it already, 42 is a peer-to-peer learning Software Developement School which gives us many different projects covering all domains
of Software Developement, it is notorious for being very selective and forming students to be complete, rigorous and independant developers. This school is
great in the sense that it teaches you to figure out things out by yourself and spend time understanding the theory behind each project to build the most
effective solution.
